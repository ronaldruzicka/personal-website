Package manager

- Always use `pnpm` package manager

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use no more than 3 function parameters or put them in an object.
- Use declarative functional programming patterns; Use immutable functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `slice`, `concat`, `toSorted`, `toReversed`, `toSpliced`, `with` etc.

Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names; A name must be short, intuitive and descriptive.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use camelCase for variable names and PascalCase for component names.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants as primitive values (e.g., API_URL).
- Avoid variable name shorthands (e.g., use `index` instead of `i`).
- For styled components use a suffix of `SC` (e.g., ButtonSC).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps or objects instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types.
- Types import separately using `type` keyword.
- Use valibot for schema validation.
- Use "Props" name for component props.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Always use curly braces in conditionals.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use early returns in if statements to avoid deep nesting; Always use curly braces for if statements.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and use curly braces for multi-line functions.

UI and Styling

- Use Panda CSS for styling.
